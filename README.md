📱 Mobile Skin Cancer Detection App  

This is a Flutter-based mobile application designed to help detect skin cancer from skin lesion images using a deep learning model. The app allows users to take or upload photos of skin lesions and provides a prediction based on trained AI models.  

✨ Features  
📸 Capture or upload skin lesion images.  
🤖 AI-based prediction using a customized pre-trained deep learning model.  
⚙️ Simple, easy-to-use interface built with Flutter.  
📊 Display prediction results to inform users of possible skin cancer risks.  

🚀 Technologies Used  
- Flutter for cross-platform mobile app development.  
- TensorFlow Lite for on-device AI inference.  
- Python for model training (outside this repo).  

🧠 AI Model
The app uses a customized deep learning model trained on a dataset of skin lesion images to classify images as benign or malignant.
